# Train Tracks
## Train Time tracking application using Firebase

### About my Code: 
There are three main peices for this application to function properly. One is the form--users should be able to fill in the form and have their inputs added to the database when they hit submit. Next the train schedule needs to pull from the database and display correctly. Lastly, the Next Arrival and Minutes Away column will need to use database data and mathematic formula to calculate the correct information to display. This calculation should happen within the DOM and does not need to be stored in the database.

In addition to the data captured by the form (first departure and frequency), I also need to use the current time in order to calculate next arrival and minutes away. All time is handled with the help of moment.js.
